Uses Alan Donovan's xsendkey.c (http://people.csail.mit.edu/adonovan/hacks/xsendkey.html).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n1. Install wmctrl (on Ubuntu run ```sudo apt-get install wmctrl```)\r\n2. ```git clone https://github.com/kyoto/sendkeys.git```\r\n3. ```cd sendkeys/```\r\n4. ```make```\r\n5. Move the compiled xsendkey binary somewhere on your ```$PATH```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nNote that the target application (e.g. Google Chrome) needs to already be open for these to work.\r\n\r\n#### Send a single key press with sendkey.sh\r\n\r\n* ```sendkey.sh 'Google Chrome' F5```\r\n\r\n#### Send a series of key presses with sendkeys.sh\r\n\r\n* ```sendkeys.sh 'Terminal' 'echo hello'```\r\n* ```sendkeys.sh 'Terminal' 'start-server.sh'```\r\n\r\n#### Open multiple web searches in Google Chrome\r\n\r\nExample bash script to open multiple web searches in different Google Chrome tabs. Takes the text file example.txt as input and searches for each line using Chrome's Omnibox.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\ntitle='Chrome'\r\ncat example.txt | while read line; do\r\n  sendkey.sh \"$title\" 'Control+t'\r\n  sendkey.sh \"$title\" 'Control+l'\r\n  sendkeys.sh \"$title\" \"$line\"\r\n  sendkey.sh \"$title\" 'Return'\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Vim\r\n\r\nexamples/vim/sendkeys.vim contains some examples of using these scripts to do common tasks in Vim.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicense details for Alan Donovan's xsendkey.c can be found at the top of that file.
